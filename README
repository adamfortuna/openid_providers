h1. About

Not all OpenID providers support lightweight profile exchange, the mechanism 
that makes requesting useful information like usernames and email
addresses possible. If username isn't provided, you might want to take a 
guess at username based on their provider.

This of course won't work for all OpenID URLs. Ideally you'll want anything
generated from this to be just a suggestion that they can change after that.

This was added as a way of getting usernames after logging in using the 
OpenID-Selector Javascript ( http://code.google.com/p/openid-selector/ ).

Feel free to use and alter.
